# Guess the Number Game

Welcome to the **Guess the Number** game! This is a simple Python game where you try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## Project Overview

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100. Your goal is to guess the number with as few attempts as possible. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too low or too high until you guess the correct number.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure you have Python installed**. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhargavtz/CodeJourneyPython.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CodeJourneyPython/projects/guess_the_number
   ```

4. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You are prompted to enter a guess.
3. The game tells you if your guess is too low or too high.
4. The game continues until you guess the correct number, and it will display the number of attempts you took.

## Example

```
Welcome to 'Guess the Number'!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 62
Congratulations! You've guessed the number 62 in 3 attempts.
```
